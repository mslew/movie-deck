This is the final project for Web and Distributed Programming. It is a Movie rating website that allows users to sign in and register, rate their favorite movies.

Future Plans: Allow users to see everyone's rating, use an API to make users rate movies that actually exist (search feature) instead of allowing them to create titles to their own movies (there is a chance that movie doesn't exist). Comment feature, public profile feature. 

I am using Vue.js, Bootstrap 5, Sass, and Firebase.
